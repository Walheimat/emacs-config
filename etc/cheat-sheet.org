* Key Bindings Cheat Sheet

Emacs has a lot of built-in functionality already bound.
I like to use them more, so I maintain this cheat sheet
to prevent me from straying too far from a beaten path.

Once I no longer need it, it will be discarded.

+ =C-t= to transpose chars

** =C-x=

*** Editing

+ =C-x C-;= (un-)comments lines
+ =C-x x g= to revert buffer
+ =C-x C-u= and =C-x C-l= up- or lower-cases region[fn:1]
+ =C-x z= repeats previous command
+ =C-x SPC= creates a rectangle mark.

** =M=

*** Editing

+ =M-<number>= to use =universal-argument= =<number>= times
+ =M-;= dwim-comments.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] These commands will need to be enabled first.
